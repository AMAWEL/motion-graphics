								<h1>DEFINITION</h1>
								<p>
									Motion graphics is animation, but with text as a major component.

											<p2>Motion design began as early as the 1800s, when early animation devices such as flip-books were invented. There were no official founders of this art form, however, Saul Bass, Pablo Ferro, and John Whitney are some of the earliest well-known motion designers.</p2>

										<p>The history of motion graphics goes back further than Adobe After Effects. One of the first uses of the term “motion graphics” was by animator John Whitney, who co-founded Motion Graphics, Inc. in 1960 to create motion picture and television title sequences. However, motion graphics dates back to before electronic media, sometime back in the 1800’s with presentation flipbooks.</p>

										<p>The origins of motion graphics are rooted in the evolution of film credits. In the early days of cinema, directors created title credits to meet the interest of this new generation of cinemagoers, who wanted to learn more about the actors in the films they saw.

									<h2>NOW AND FUTURE</h2>
								</header>
								<b><h2>TYPES</h2></article></b>
								
								<p>ANIMATED TYPOGRAPHY</p>
								<p>Animated typography (often known as kinetic typography) is a great way to add a few seconds of screen time for your brand wordmark or company catchphrase. You can also create an entire explainer video using animated typography. Simply put, animated typography is moving text.</p>
								<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/typography.jpg" alt=""></a>
				
									<div>
										<br>
										<h3>ANIMATED TITLES</h3>
										<p>Advanced title animation and placement over existing video is meant to enhance a message, point to a specific feature or object in the video, or introduce a topic or person with motion titles.</p>
										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/animated titles.jpg" alt=""></a>
											<br>
											<h4>ANIMATED LOGOS</h4>
											<P>Also called production logos or vanity cards, animated logos use original animation styles and elements to help tell a brand’s story by putting its logo in motion.</P>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/animated logos.gif" alt=""></a>
							
											</div>
											<br>
		
										<h5>ANIMATED GRAPHIC LOOPS</h5>
										<P>Animated graphic loops are short animations that loop seamlessly, usually without any sound. They use illustrated, vector, text, or photo elements.</P>
										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/loops.gif" alt=""></a>
											<br>
											<h6>ANIMATED EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h6>
											<P>They incorporate music and sound effects as well as unique animation styles and custom visuals to communicate your ideas in the most direct but memorable way possible.</P>	
											<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/explainer video.jpeg" alt=""></a>
												<br>
												<b><h7>RRODUCT ANIMATIONS</h7></b>
												<P>Product animations are a type of explainer animation that highlight features of a product or service through both typographic and illustrative elements. The reason they are separated from explainer videos or UI/UX explainers is because of their underlying purpose: A product animation uses motion graphics to quickly and simply illustrate how a product works</P>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/product promo.gif" alt=""></a>
										</div>
										<br>
										<b><h8> UI/UX ANIMATIONS</h8></b>
										<P>UI/UX animations are a type of explainer video. However, they are unique in that they take on nearly the exact format of the user interface being explained. This means there are very few extra elements aside from what the user can expect from the actual app or website.</P>
										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ui ux.gif" alt=""></a>
											<br>
											<b><h9> ANIMATED ADS</h9></b>
											<p>Animated ads are short videos that focus on specific key points of your business. They supplement full animated explainers, which aim to tell comprehensive brand stories and are capped at 90 seconds. Unlike full explainers, these ads hone in on specific features, timely promos, or other special events.</p>
											<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/animatd ads.png" alt=""></a>
												<br>
												<header><b><h9> TRANSPARENT ANIMATED ADS</h9></header></b>
											
												<p>Very similar to advanced animated titles, transparent animated assets function a bit like still PNG images: They’re rendered with transparency enabled so that you or your video editor can easily put them on top of existing footage. Layering elements, often referred to as compositing in video work, allows motion graphics artists to create custom elements you can overlay on any video or image you already have.

			                                         They’re perfect for video intros, outros, and transitions. </p>

										                <b><header>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</header></div></b>
							                 <p>Artificial intelligence can be used in motion graphics in several ways. One way is to use AI to create motion graphics that are more realistic and lifelike. For example, you can use AI to create animations of people or animals that move and behave realistically. Hint, hint… the Roto Brush of today will only need a couple of clicks and about 10 seconds to generate what currently takes hours of meticulous tweaking</p>

										 <b><header>MOTION CAPTURE/LIVE OUTPUT</header></b>
								                  <p>As one of the newer applications added to the Adobe CC family, Adobe Character Animator was modestly introduced a few years ago as a simplified and more organized way to animate characters. The new tool proved to be faster and more fluid than the formerly-used Puppet Tool. Adobe expanded the capabilities of the tool to motion capture your head and facial movements using just your webcam and microphone. </p>
								                           <div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
									                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/MOTO CAP.jpg" alt=""></a>
									        <br><br>
													<b><header>INTEGRATION</header></b>
									              <p>Applications having the ability to integrate or collaborate is not a strikingly new concept. However, the number of integration capabilities made possible every year in After Effects (and Adobe Creative Cloud in general) is rapidly increasing.</p>
									                <div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
										             <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/integration.png" alt=""></a>
